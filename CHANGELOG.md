- ðŸŽ¯ **Flicker-Free Navigation**: Eliminated page flickering during programmatic jumps
- âš¡ **Large Dataset Support**: Optimized for 100,000+ items with constant memory usage
- ðŸ”„ **Improved View Recycling**: Better view lifecycle management during large jumps

- **Enhanced**: `goToPage` method completely rewritten for performance
- **Optimized**: View loading strategy for large jumps
- **Improved**: Scroll delegate handling during programmatic navigation

### Technical Details
- Modified `PagerView.goToPage()` to clear intermediate views on large jumps
- Added `isProgrammaticNavigation` flag to prevent scroll delegate interference  
- Ensured `currentIndex` is set before `computeViewState()` for proper view alignment
- Implemented temporary delegate disabling during navigation to prevent settling issues

### Performance Improvements
- **Navigation Speed**: Large jumps now happen instantly regardless of distance
- **Memory Usage**: Constant memory footprint regardless of dataset size or jump distance
- **UI Stability**: No more flickering or incorrect page display during navigation
- **Responsiveness**: Immediate user feedback for all navigation actions

## [0.x.x] - Previous Versions
- Based on original SwiftUI-LazyPager by Brian Floersch
- Basic paging functionality with performance limitations for large datasets
